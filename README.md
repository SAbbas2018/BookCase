# BookCase

## Note
  The application is hosted on Heroku's Free tier, and as such goes into hibernation when idle.
  Therefore, when accessing the app for the first time, it may take some time to load as it wakes from
  hibernation.

## Description
	This is the code for a MERN stack application that is deployed on heroku.
	
	I first did all the work in my BookCase repo, however when it came to deploying 
	the project I found it best to set that file structure as is here, and deploy 
	the front end and backend together on heroku.
	
	The application uses the Google Books API for getting information on books by their
	ISBN, and to make recommendations.
	
	The application is still under construction, and I will continue to try to improve 
	the code.

## Technologies Used
	- MERN Stack [MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js]
	- VScode
	- Postman for testing backend routes
	- Git and Github for version control
